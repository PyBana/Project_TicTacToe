# TicTacToe

## Overview

This is my first project which I completed entirely on my own. I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python to test and reinforce my foundational knowledge of the language. Although the game currently features a text-based interface, my next goal is to learn how to create graphical user interfaces (GUI) and implement one for this game.

## Features

- Two-player game on a 3x3 grid
- Turn-based gameplay
- Input validation to ensure correct and legal moves
- Win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines
- Draw detection when all cells are filled without a winner

## How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column number.
3. The game will display the updated board after each move.
4. The game announces the winner or a draw when applicable.

## Future Improvements

- GUI Implementation: My next step is to learn about GUI development in Python and integrate it into this project to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
- Enhanced Features: Add options for single-player mode with AI, different board sizes, and custom symbols.

## Learning Experience

This project has been a valuable learning experience, helping me to solidify my understanding of Python basics such as:

- Variables and data types
- Control structures (if-else statements, loops)
- Functions and modular programming
- Basic error handling 

## Conclusion

Completing this project has been a significant milestone in my programming journey. I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills, particularly in GUI development, to take this project to the next level. Thank you for checking out my Tic-Tac-Toe game!

Feel free to provide feedback or suggestions for improvement. Your support and input are greatly appreciated!
