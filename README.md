## Overview

This is my first project which I completed entirely on my own. I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python to test and reinforce my foundational knowledge of the language. Additionally, I created a Java version of the game to expand my understanding of object-oriented programming and Java syntax. Although both games currently feature a text-based interface, my next goal is to learn how to create graphical user interfaces (GUI) and implement them for these games.

## Features

- Two-player game on a 3x3 grid
- Turn-based gameplay
- Input validation to ensure correct and legal moves
- Win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines
- Draw detection when all cells are filled without a winner

## How to Play

### Python Version

  1. Run the script in a Python environment.
  2. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column number.
  3. The game will display the updated board after each move.
  4. The game announces the winner or a draw when applicable.

### Java Version

  1. Compile and run the Java program.
  2. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column number.
  3. The game will display the updated board after each move.
  4. The game announces the winner or a draw when applicable..

## Future Improvements

- GUI Implementation: My next step is to learn about GUI development in Python and integrate it into this project to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
- Enhanced Features: Add options for single-player mode with AI, different board sizes, and custom symbols.

## Learning Experience

This project has been a valuable learning experience, helping me to solidify my understanding of the following concepts:

### Python

  - Variables and data types
  - Control structures (if-else statements, loops)
  - Functions and modular programming
  - Basic error handling

### Java

  - Object-oriented programming principles
  - Class and object usage
  - Java syntax and libraries
  - Exception handling

## Conclusion

Completing this project has been a significant milestone in my programming journey. I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills, particularly in GUI development, to take these projects to the next level. Thank you for checking out my Tic-Tac-Toe games!

Feel free to provide feedback or suggestions for improvement. Your support and input are greatly appreciated!
